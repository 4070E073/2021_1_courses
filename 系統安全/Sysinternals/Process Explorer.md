How to exposing detailed process information#@Windows?

Process Explorer (Procexp)
```
# key features
```
Tree view, which shows parent/child process relationships
Color coding, which identifies the process type and state, 
 such as services, .NET processes,“immersive” processes, suspended processes, 
 processes running as the same user as Procexp,
 processes that are part of a job, and packed images
Tooltips, which show command-line and other process information
 Colored highlighting, for calling attention to new processes, recently exited processes, and
processes consuming CPU and other resources
 Fractional CPU, provided so that processes consuming very low amounts of CPU time do not
appear completely inactive
 More accurate indication of CPU consumption based on CPU cycle counts
 Identification of images flagged as suspicious by VirusTotal.com
 Identification of protected processes and the type of protection
 Task Manager replacement—so that you can have Process Explorer run whenever Task
Manager is requested
 Start automatically at logon
 Identification of process’ autostart locations if any
 Identification of which process owns any visible window on your desktop
 Identification of a top-level window belonging to a given process, and the ability to bring it
forward or close it
 Identification of all dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) and mapped files loaded by a process and all
handles to kernel objects opened by a process
 Ability to find which processes have open handles to kernel objects such as files or folders
 Ability to find which processes have loaded a DLL, and identify its path and other attributes
 Graphical representations of CPU activity, memory usage, I/O activity, and Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) activity, both systemwide and per-process
 Detailed metrics of memory usage, I/O activity, and GPU activity
 Detailed information about a process security context
 Detailed information about process TCP/IP endpoints
 Ability to view process threads, including their start addresses and stacks
 Ability to suspend a process, change a process’ priority, or terminate a process or a process
tree
 Ability to create process dumps
