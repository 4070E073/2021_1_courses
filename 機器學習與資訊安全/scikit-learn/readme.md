# 機器學習 Machine learning (ML)
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning
```
```
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that 
improve automatically through experience.[1][2] 

It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. 

Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", 
in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[3] 

Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, 
such as email filtering and computer vision, 
where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms 
to perform the needed tasks.
```
```
Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, 
which focuses on making predictions using computers. 

The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, 
theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. 

Data mining is a related field of study, 
focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[5][6] 

In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.
```
```
Simple Definition: Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) 
that provides systems the ability to automatically learn 
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 

Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

### Alan Turing  | Turing test
```
"Can machines think?"  “機器能思考嗎？”
```

Computing Machinery and Intelligence
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence

“運算機器與智能」（Computing Machinery and Intelligence）”是人工智能的話題書面圖靈一個開創性論文。
該論文發表於1950年的《 Mind》，是第一個向公眾介紹他的現在稱為圖靈測試的概念的論文。
圖靈的論文考慮了“機器能思考嗎？”的問題。

### Turing test
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test

The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950,
is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, 
or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
